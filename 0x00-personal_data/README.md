# Personal Data Project

## Overview

This project focuses on handling personal data securely in a backend application. It covers topics such as identifying Personally Identifiable Information (PII), implementing log filters to obfuscate sensitive data, encrypting passwords, and authenticating to databases using environment variables.

## Project Details

- **Start Date:** August 28, 2024 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** August 30, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline
- **Manual QA Review:** Required (request when finished)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- How to implement a log filter to obfuscate PII fields
- How to encrypt a password and check its validity
- How to authenticate to a database using environment variables

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Python 3.7
- Pycodestyle 2.5
- All files must be executable
- Modules, classes, and functions must have documentation

## Tasks

1. **Regex-ing**: Implement a function to obfuscate sensitive data in log messages.
2. **Log formatter**: Create a custom log formatter to redact specified fields.
3. **Create logger**: Implement a function to create a logger with specific configurations.
4. **Connect to secure database**: Create a function to connect to a MySQL database using environment variables.
5. **Read and filter data**: Implement a main function to retrieve and display filtered user data.
6. **Encrypting passwords**: Create a function to hash passwords securely.
7. **Check valid password**: Implement a function to validate hashed passwords.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/emmanuelist/alx-backend-user-data.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd alx-backend-user-data/0x00-personal_data
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip3 install mysql-connector-python
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script for each task to test the implementation. For example:

```
./filtered_logger.py
```
